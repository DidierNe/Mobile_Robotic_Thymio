    "The localization of the Thymio robot is performed using a Kalman filter. This filtering method is well suited to estimating the position and orientation of a mobile robot from noisy or incomplete measurements. The design of the filter in this project is based on using the position ($x, y$) and orientation ($\\theta$) provided by the camera as measurements. In addition, the speed of the robot, provided by the wheel speed sensors ($v_r, v_l$), is used as a prediction. In short, the Kalman filter merges a prediction of the system's future state with a measurement of that state to estimate position probabilistically."
