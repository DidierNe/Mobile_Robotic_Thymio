    "The robotâ€™s movement from its starting position to the target is executed using the coordinates of the global path. To transition from one coordinate to the next, a specific method has been adopted. The robot begins by orienting itself towards the next point, taking into account its current orientation. Once the orientation is adjusted, the robot performs a straight-line movement to the next point. This step is repeated from position to position until the final destination is reached. The basic functions therefore include: activation and deactivation of motors, rotation by a defined angle, and linear movement over a defined distance."
